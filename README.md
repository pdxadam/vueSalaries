# Salary Schedule Analyzer

This program allows setting up salary schedules in scenarios (or contracts, or contract proposals). The data is all stored on your computer in local storage--download backups of your scenarios to protect your data or to share it with others. 

## This program can:
= Take both salaries and FTE counts at each cell in the salary schedule. 
- Take an insurance contribution for each employee per month.
- Calculates the cost of each schedule and adds them up to get a full cost for the entire scenario.
- Apply an Associated Payroll cost to the entire scenario and provide a separate total including that.

## Future
- Compare two scenarios
- Add miscellaneous costs to be considered
- Export schedules to Excel
- Do an insurance pool calculator (though how these are calculated varies widely from district to district)
